This is 2D physics engine which serves as growing collection of a whole bunch of techniques for collision detection and resolution.

There is a discrete collision detection system, as well as a swept detection system which is under development. The collision detection algorithms in here are SAT, GJK, and MPR. GJK by far has the most work done on it, but I do have plans on expanding on MPR as well.
